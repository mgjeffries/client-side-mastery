# Using the Data Provider

A data provider module in an application has the responsibility of maintaining the state of a particular type of data. In this application, the `FishDataProvider` module holds the state of each fish. Other modules in the application can request that state, and then use it for whatever they are responsible for.

Some common module reponsibilities are:

1. Displaying HTML representations of state.
1. Filtering objects in state. For example, one view in the application could be to only show orange fish, or fish of a certain size, or fish found in a certain location.
1. Sorting objects in state by size, date harvested, etc.

## Logging the Fish

You start simple and just use `console.log()` to display all the fish that are in application state. First, you need a function in the data provider whose responsibility is to allow other modules to access the state.

Here's the simplest way to do that. The function below just returns a reference to the fish collection. The function is exported so other modules can import it and use it.

> **`scripts/FishDataProvider.js`**

```js
// You already have this code. Don't add this
const fishCollection = [...]

// This is new code. Add this.
export const useFish = () => {
    return fishCollection.slice()
}
```

Next, you import that function into the main module. Then you can invoke the function and store the fish collection in a variable that is scoped to the main module. Then just log each fish object to the developer console.

> **Note:** The imported function is wrapped in curly braces. This is needed for anything that is exported from a module that isn't the `default` export.

> **`scripts/main.js`**

```js
import { useFish } from './FishDataProvider.js'

const allTheFish = useFish()

for (const fish of allTheFish) {
    console.log(fish)
}
```

## Next Steps

Once you get this working, move on to the next chapter to learn how to make modules that are responsible for defining components - one for the list of fish, and one for the individual fish. Once done, you will have an automated machine for generating the HTML representations of the fish.
