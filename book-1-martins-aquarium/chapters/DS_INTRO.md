# Dotard & Simbleton

![dotard and simbleton](./images/dotard-simbleton.jpg)

Since one of your primary jobs as a software developer will be to filter, transform, organize, sort, and then display collections of data, you will need to know how to use some of the helpful methods that software development languages provide to perform those operations.

Up until now, you have relied upon the base `for` loop mechanism in JavaScript. These array methods will let you perform more advanced operations on collections with far less code.

During this lesson, you will be helping Doris. Doris owns a paper distribution and services franchise of Dotard & Simbleton. While she operates a paper franchise, she realizes that far too much of her operation is done on paper and she needs to start building software to automate processes and eliminate waste.

To help solve her problems, you will use the following methods that are automatically available on any array in JavaScript.

1. `forEach()`
1. `filter()`
1. `map()`
1. `find()`

## Setup

Create the directories and files with the following commands. You can copy/pasta all four commands into your terminal at the same time and run them.

```sh
mkdir -p ~/workspace/dotard-simbleton/scripts
mkdir -p ~/workspace/dotard-simbleton/styles
cd ~/workspace/dotard-simbleton
touch index.html scripts/main.js scripts/BusinessProvider.js scripts/BusinessList.js scripts/Business.js styles/main.css
```

## Your First Day at Dotard & Simbleton

It's your first day on the job, and Doris sits with you at your desk and talks about what she needs you to do.

> "Thank you for joining the team! We really need your help," she says as she drops a huge pile of paper on the corner of your desk, making a deep *thud* sound.
>
> "This is a list of all companies that have active accounts for purchasing any kind of paper from Dotard & Simbleton. What I need you to do is make it electronic."
>
> She waves her hands vaguely, and follows up with, "Like a web page, or something!"
>
> You blink at her, not even knowing how to respond.
>
> Doris smiles weakly, stands up and blurts out, "Well... you get started on that and let me know when you're done."
>
> You stare at the giant, multi-colored pile of papers trying to decide what just happened, and how you're going to do this. After a minute of staring, you hear a gentle voice behind you.
>
> "Hey there, we actually have those recorded on a hard drive. You don't have to do that part."
>
> You turn around and see a tall, spindly man with thinning hair, blue trousers, a wrinkled white dress shirt, and blue suspenders. While sizing him up, you ask, "Um, what hard drive?"
>
> He smiles and points at your desk. "It's in your top drawer there. I'm Howard, by the way, nice to meet you," as he leans towards you with his hand extended.
>
> You shake his hand - firmly you hope - and he wheels his chair over and helps you connect the drive to your machine. He explains that Doris' niece spent the last summer trying to do what you've been hired to do, but only got as far as entering in the active businesses, and the sales for the last 2 years.
>
> As you open the files on the hard drive, here's what you find in one of them.

Each file contains an array with 15 objects in it. Each object represents one active customer. It details the address, purchasing agent, and the total dollar amount of that company's last 5 orders.

## forEach() Method

So Doris just wants to see all of the business names on a web page. You remember that the `forEach()` method on an array iterates the array and you can write logic for what to do for each item in it. You just want to build some elements to put in the DOM to look like this.

Since each object is identical in its structure (but not its state), you can write some automation logic with `forEach()`. Here's an example of using `forEach` to iterate an array of objects that represent art supplies.

### Example Usage of `forEach()`

> **`SuppliesProvider.js`**

```js
const supplies = [
    {
        id: 1,
        price: 12.99,
        color: "Red",
        brand: "Bloomfield",
        type: "Paint"
    },
    {
        id: 2,
        price: 75.49,
        color: "Brown",
        brand: "Illinois Art",
        type: "Easel"
    },
    {
        id: 3,
        price: 19.99,
        color: "White",
        brand: "Emerson",
        type: "Oil Paint Canvas"
    }
]

export const useSupplies = () => {
    return supplies.slice()
}
```

> **`SupplyList.js`**

```js
import { useSupplies } from "./SuppliesProvider.js"
import { Supply } from "./Supply.js"

const contentTarget = document.querySelector(".supplies")

const SupplyList = () => {
    const supplyArray = useSupplies()
    contentTarget.innerHTML = "<h1>Art Supplies</h1>"

    supplyArray.forEach(
        (supplyObject) => {
            contentTarget.innerHTML += Supply(supplyObject)
        }
    );
}
```

> **`Supply.js`**

```js
export const Supply = (supplyObject) => {
    return `
        <section class="supply">
            <h2 class="supply__type">${supplyObject.type}</h2>
            <div class="supply__price">
                Price: ${supplyObject.price}
            </div>
        </section>
    `
}
```


## Videos With More Examples

You can watch some videos where other developers show you other examples of how to use the `.forEach()` method on an array.

## Task: Listing Purchasing Companies

Your task is to use the `forEach()` array method to list all of the companies so that Doris can easily browse a list of her customers. Use the example code above as a starting point. The list of companies should look like the image below.

1. The variable name whose value is the list of customers is different
1. `supplyObject` is not an appropriate parameter name to store a single object representing a company.
1. The class names in the HTML string will be different.
1. The properties will also need to change. Purchasing company objects have very different property names (_e.g. `addressFullStreet`_)
